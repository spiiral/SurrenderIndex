a little web scraper i wrote for my friend's punting spreadsheet 

run in terminal and when prompted for input enter a link of any game's box score page from pro-football-reference.com


such as: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202209190buf.htm

you will be given formatted output showing the details of each punt in the game ex:


q  time    down   y2g    fieldPos   punter         score
1  5:15    4      8      BUF 45     Riley Dixon    7-0
2  14:20   4      3      LAR 31     Riley Dixon    7-0
3  13:10   4      11     LAR 10     Riley Dixon    10-10
3  5:18    4      18     LAR 50     Riley Dixon    17-10
